## Command Line Parsing using Clara Library:
- After compiling the file, run it using (ex: ./app) and add the path to the input file then path of output file (ex: ./app Task1/Input.txt  /Task1/Output.txt)
- Note: Don't switch the order of the arguments as they are stored in variables in this order.
