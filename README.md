## Command Line Parsing using Clara Library:
- After compiling the file *CommandLineArguments.cpp*, run it using (ex: ./app) and add the path to the input files then path of output file (ex: ./app   pathOfTheFile/Input1.txt  pathOfTheFile/Input1.txt   pathOfTheFile/Output.txt).
- Note: Don't switch the order of the arguments as they are stored in variables in this order.
## Using FileParser
- Arguments required are:
    Directory of the first text file (ex: /home/user/directory/txtfile.txt)
    One of the following operations ("plus" - "minus" - "multiply" - "divide")
    Directory of the second text file
    Separate each argument with a single space
- Output will be in the same file directory as (results.txt)
