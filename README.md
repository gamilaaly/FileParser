## Command Line Parsing using Clara Library:
- After compiling the file *CommandLineArguments.cpp*, run it using (ex: ./app) and add the path to the input file then path of output file (ex: ./app   pathOfTheFile/Input.txt    pathOfTheFile/Output.txt).
- Note: Don't switch the order of the arguments as they are stored in variables in this order.
